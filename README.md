### Intialization

### Iteration A1

    rake db:create # create databases
    rake db:migrate

### Iteration A2

Copyrighted book description test data... _Seriously?_

A bit more orientation, I am _typing_ changes -- except for the seed data and css files. I want the experience of _creating_ the application, and fixing errors. Last year, when attempting to get through this, _Iteration A2_ was where the waters got rough. Perhaps the css has been tweaked, or I have become more savvy, but now, index view styling worked easily.
